npm test
npm run test:e2e

# Deploy immediately if tests pass
```

#### Regular Updates (Monthly)
```bash
# Check outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update non-major versions
npm update

# For major version updates, review breaking changes first
npm install package-name@latest

# Test thoroughly
npm test
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:security

# Deploy via normal process
```

### Database Updates
